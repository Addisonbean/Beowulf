everything labeled "TODO"
use gameData everywhere/refactor it
get good sprites (x1 and x2 resolution, from Aaron?)
cleanup js/item.js
add weapons
make the inventory useful
add more items
keyword arguments for Item?
fix map initialization (make a visit/goto method, don't init right away) is it even broken? I don't think so...
use elements from the Beowulf story
add stats like health (hp and xp?), move money into the stats
use a collision test kinda thing instead of a collideWith method
create a subclass for Hero and Enemy
add rank up/level crap (xp?)
don't hardcode canvas size in js
